# AzureResourcingBasicVMProvisioning
A repository to house my hello world projects to understand various aspects of provisioning via ARM on Azure.

This example is to record the provisioning of a r12 Windows Server VM and configuring a simple .txt file into
the VM using DSC. The various templates and powershell scripts were put together after going through several
examples on the web and taking various aspects of configuration needed.
