# AzureResourcingBasicVMProvisioning
A repository to house my hello world projects to understand various aspects of provisioning via ARM on Azure.

This example is to record the provisioning of a r12 Windows Server VM and configuring a simple .txt file into
the VM using DSC. The various templates and powershell scripts were grabbed of the web for this test.
